## Overview
---
Replant World is dedicated to combating climate change through tree planting initiatives. The organization primarily operates in the tropical forests of Indonesia, areas where natural rainforests are being depleted due to the expansion of commercial agriculture and animal farming. Replant World not only contributes to reforestation but also provides income opportunities for local residents. These individuals are employed to plant various species of trees and are compensated for their efforts.


## Workflow
---
The Planter, a member of a planting organization or a local community, is tasked with the crucial role of planting trees. To verify their work, the Planter will capture a picture of every planted tree, assign an appropriate tree species and upload the photos for the Admin's review. The Planters app allows capturing the plants in offline mode and once the device is back online upload all prepared submissions.


The Admin, a Replant World representative, assesses each planted tree's quality. Accepted work results in the Planter receiving payment for each tree. If the work is rejected, the Planter must replant and resubmit a new photo for the subsequent review cycle. This process ensures Replant World maintains a high standard for the quality and variety of the species planted.

Once a tree's photograph is approved, it is assigned to the appropriate sponsor and then converted into a Tree Token â€“ an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) on SEI Blockchain. This token represents the proof, that the sponsored tree has been planted - the proof of planting. The Tree NFT is visible in the sponsor's crypto wallet and the Replant World NFT Gallery. In the future, each Sponsor will have a separate profile within the NFT gallery with their sponsorship portfolio, which can shared via URL (as a preview). Each Tree Token's location will be marked on the map. Furthermore, Tree Tokens will be traded on secondary markets.

Funding for Replant World currently comes from sponsors, private individuals and companies, directly approached by the organization. In the future this aspect is planned to transition to the application, enabling seamless Tree Token purchases. 

The new application, catering to both crypto and non-crypto users, will facilitate contributions through fiat and cryptocurrencies. Embracing an inclusive approach is critical to ensure that no potential supporter is deterred by the method of contribution.


## Core functionalities

###  Planters app 
 

1. **Create an account**

    Planter creates an account using a dedicated sign-up link generated by the admin and shared via an organization or community coordinator.
    During sign-up, the planter provides necessary details such as username, phone number, password, and selects their country from a dropdown list.

2. **Log in**

    After creating an account, the planter can log in to the app using their credentials (username and password).

3. **Install the PWA**

    The Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality allows users to install the app on their devices for easy access.
    Users are prompted to install the PWA when they visit the app's website, providing a seamless mobile app-like experience without the need to download from an app store.

4. **Capture tree**

    This feature allows the planter to take a photo of a tree they have planted directly within the app. 
    The app automatically tracks the location of the planted tree using the photo's metadata, ensuring accurate geotagging.
    To specify the tree species, the user selects from a dropdown menu containing species assigned to the planter's organization or community.
    After capturing the photo and selecting the species, the planter can submit the tree planting details for review.
     The submission includes the photo, species information, geotagged location, and any additional notes provided by the planter.
    Once submitted, the tree planting entry is added to the user's submission list for tracking and review.

5. **Dashboard**

    Through the dashboard users can quickly access key metrics related to their contributions to environmental conservation efforts, including the total number of trees planted, number pending approval, number accepted, and number rejected.
Additionally, the dashboard displays the three latest submissions made by the user, including details such as species, planting location, date submitted, and status.

6. **Submission list**

    This feature displays a list of all tree planting submissions made by the user.
Users can review their past submission and track the progress of each planted tree.
Each submission entry includes details such as the tree species, planting location, date submitted, and status (pending approval, accepted, or rejected).
Users can easily navigate through their submission history, ensuring transparency and accountability in their tree planting efforts.

7. **User profile**

    The user profile section allows users to view their account details.
This feature provides users with control over their account information, ensuring a personalized and secure user experience within the app.

10. **Offline work**

    Users can capture tree planting details even when offline, enabling them to document their efforts regardless of internet connectivity.
While offline, users can take photos, select tree species, and input planting location information.
Upon returning online, users can access the submission section to upload their offline submissions to the server for review.
The only requirement for online connectivity is during the initial login process, where the app downloads required data such as tree species information and organizational/community details.
Once logged in and data is downloaded, users can freely go to the fields to capture their plants without the need for continuous internet access.
This offline functionality ensures that users can contribute to tree planting efforts even in remote areas or locations with limited connectivity, enhancing accessibility and participation in environmental conservation initiatives.

### Backoffice

1. **Create planting organization/ community**

    Admin can create new planting organizations or communities within the backoffice.
To create an organization, admins provide its name, countries of activity, and contact person information including email address.
Once the organization is created, the admin generates a unique sign-up link.
The sign-up link is intended for planters to use when registering with the organization's tree planting initiative.
Each sign-up link is valid for 7 days, after which it expires. If needed, the admin can generate a new sign-up link for the organization.
This feature streamlines the process of onboarding new planters, ensuring they have access to the organization's initiatives while maintaining security and control over sign-up access.

2. **Add tree species**

    Admin can add new tree species to the platform to expand the available options for users when documenting their tree planting activities. To add a new tree species, admins provide the following information:
    - Common name: The commonly used name of the tree species.
    - Botanical name: The scientific name of the tree species.
    - IUCN status: The conservation status of the tree species as classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This status provides information about the species' risk of extinction in the wild. 


    This feature allows admins to maintain an up-to-date and diverse database of tree species, enhancing the platform's utility and relevance in environmental conservation efforts.

3. **Assign tree species to the planting organization**

    Admin can assign specific tree species to different planting organizations or communities, tailoring the available options based on the organization's preferences, geographical location, or ecological considerations.
    When assigning tree species, admins provide the following additional information:
    - Country: Admins select the country or countries where the planting organization operates or plans to conduct tree planting initiatives.
    - Native status: Admins indicate whether the tree species is native to the selected country or not. This information helps ensure the ecological suitability of the species for the chosen planting locations.
    - Planting costs: Admins specify the planting costs associated with each tree species, including logistics costs such as transportation and distribution. This information assists organizations in budgeting and planning their tree planting projects effectively.

    The assigned tree species are later used to filter the entire species database available to the planter while capturing the tree.
    When capturing a tree, the planter can choose from the species assigned to their organization, ensuring that only relevant and suitable options are presented during the tree planting process.

4. **Review planting submissions**

    Admin have the responsibility to review and manage tree planting submissions made by users through the app.
Upon reviewing a submission, admins can choose to accept or reject the planted trees based on various criteria such as accuracy, completeness, and adherence to guidelines.
When rejecting a submission, admins are required to provide a rejection reason, ensuring clear communication with the planter about the decision.
Common rejection reasons may include incomplete information, non-compliance with planting guidelines, or other issues unrelated to species assignment.
If the submission pertains to incorrect species assignment, the tree itself is not rejected, admins have the option to edit the species information to rectify the mistake without rejecting the entire submission.
This editing capability allows admins to correct errors and ensure accurate documentation of tree planting activities, without penalizing the planter for the species assignment mistake.
By providing clear feedback and the ability to make necessary corrections, admins facilitate collaboration with planters and promote continuous improvement in tree planting efforts.

5. **Create sponsor profile**

    Admins can create sponsor profiles within the backoffice, representing individuals or companies supporting tree planting initiatives financially or through other means.
When creating a sponsor profile, admins provide the following information:
    - Sponsor name: The name of the sponsor, which can be either a company or an individual.
    -  Contact person: The full name of the contact person representing the sponsor, along with their email address for communication purposes.
    - SEI wallet address: The address of the sponsor's SEI wallet, which serves as the destination wallet for the Proof of Planting NFTs.
    - Ordered NFTs: Admins can specify the quantity or dollar value of NFTs ordered by the sponsor as part of their sponsorship agreement.
    - Comments: A field for additional comments or notes related to the sponsor profile or sponsorship agreement.

    This feature provides admins with a comprehensive toolset for managing sponsor relationships and facilitating the issuance of Proof of Planting NFTs to sponsors, enhancing transparency and accountability in tree planting initiatives.

6. **Assing accepted trees to the sponsors**

    The assignment of accepted trees to sponsors is handled automatically according to an algorithm implemented in the system.
    Admins specify the criteria for assigning trees to sponsors based on the planting organization or community.
Additionally, admins have the option to specify the exact or maximum cost of a single tree that can be assigned to a sponsor.
When assigning trees to sponsors, the system takes into account the planting organization or community, as well as the specified cost criteria.
Based on the order quantity or ordered value specified in the sponsoring agreement, the system assigns trees to sponsors in a fair and efficient manner.
The assignment algorithm ensures equitable distribution of trees among sponsors while respecting the constraints and preferences set by admins.
This automated process streamlines the management of sponsor-tree assignments, reducing manual effort and ensuring transparency and fairness in the distribution of tree planting contributions among sponsors.

7. **Mint NFT tokens**

    Admins have the authority to trigger the minting process for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within the platform.
To optimize efficiency and reduce transaction costs on the blockchain, admins typically choose to mint NFTs in batches rather than individually.
Batch minting involves grouping multiple NFTs together and minting them as a single transaction on the blockchain, thereby minimizing the number of transactions generated.
The platform utilizes the SEI blockchain for minting NFTs, leveraging its capabilities for secure and transparent tokenization of tree planting activities.
By minting NFTs in batches, the platform ensures efficient utilization of blockchain resources while maintaining a consistent flow of tokenized proof of planting assets.
This approach enhances scalability and cost-effectiveness in managing NFT minting operations, facilitating the seamless integration of blockchain technology into tree planting initiatives.

8. **Minting history**

    The minting history feature provides admins with a comprehensive log of all NFT minting activities conducted on the platform.
In the event of failed transactions, the minting history log can provide valuable insights into the reasons for the failure.
Admins can analyze the minting history to identify patterns or issues that may have contributed to failed transactions, allowing them to address any underlying problems and optimize the minting process.
By leveraging the minting history log to diagnose and resolve failed transactions, the platform enhances operational efficiency and reliability, ensuring smooth and successful tokenization of tree planting activities.

### NFT Gallery

The NFT gallery serves as a centralized repository where all minted NFTs are showcased, providing a comprehensive overview of tree planting activities documented on the platform.
Each NFT displayed in the gallery represents a unique tree planting event, tokenized as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on the blockchain.
The NFT gallery includes detailed information about each tree planting event, such as the plant's species, planting location, planter, and sponsor.
Users can brows through the NFT gallery and epxlore the profiles of sponsors supporting the reforestation projects.
