# Icons

Generic icons. Ideally, only from Material Symbols.

## Development notes

Try to use only Material Symbols. Go to:

https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.style=Outlined

settings:
fill - true
weight - 400 (default)
grade - 0 (default)
optical size - 24 (default)
style - outlined

Download SVGs and remake into React components.

Naming: use the same names as in Material Symbols.

If fill is false, add "Line" suffix to icon name, e.g. ImageLine
