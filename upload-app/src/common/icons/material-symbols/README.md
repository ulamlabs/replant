# Icons

Generic icons. Ideally, only from Material Symbols.

## Development notes

Try to use only Material Symbols. Go to:

https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.style=Outlined

default icon settings:
fill - true
weight - 400
grade - 0
optical size - 24
style - outlined

Download SVGs and remake into React components.

Naming: use the same names as in Material Symbols.

If other settings are used, document this in icon component file. (see ImageLine.tsx)
